These programs do not use the MATLAB 'upfirdn' command.

These programs use linear convolution.  The boundaries of the signals are not circularly or symmetrically extended. 
Linear convolution implicitly uses zeros outside the signal boundaries.

The low-pass signal in the synthesis channel will be longer than (or equal in length to) the high-pass signal because of the iteration on the low-pass channel.  Therefore, we truncate the signal down in length to match the high-pass channel.
